# Sentinels of the Please-Don't-Sue-Me

Sentinels of the Please-Don't-Sue-Me is an app I am writing as part of a spike to see if I can use AngularJS in my capstone project. I am sincerely making efforts to not violate copyright laws; this is meant to be a fun supplement for people who own the game, and NOT to replace ownership of the game in any way. I am not making any money off of this. It is meant to facilitate long-distance gaming; it can be really hard to keep track of targets and HP when half of your heroes are in Washington, D.C. and the other half are in Seattle.

## Do you have any thoughts/concerns about how to make sure this is a supplement and not competing content?

I started this project with the angular-seed gem, found here: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed . The companion API lives here: https://github.com/shanghaiellen/sentinels-api
